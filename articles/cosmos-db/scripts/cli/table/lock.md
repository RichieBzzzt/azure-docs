# Create resource lock for a Azure Cosmos DB Table API table using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-table-api](../../../includes/appliesto-table-api.md)]

The script in this article demonstrates performing resource lock operations for a Table API table.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> To create resource locks, you must have membership in the owner role in the subscription.
>
> Resource locks do not work for changes made by users connecting Cosmos DB Table SDK, Azure Storage Table SDK, any tools that connect via account keys, or the Azure Portal unless the Cosmos DB account is first locked with the `disableKeyBasedMetadataWriteAccess` property enabled. To learn more about how to enable this property see, [Preventing changes from SDKs](../../../role-based-access-control.md#prevent-sdk-changes).

## Sample script

[!INCLUDE [cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md](../../../../../includes/cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md)]

### Run the script

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azure_cli_scripts/cosmosdb/table/lock.sh" id="FullScript":::

## Clean up resources
